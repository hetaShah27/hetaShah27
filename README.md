Welcome to my profile! My name is **Heta Shah** and I am a recent Graduate from the **University of Texas at Dallas**. I Mastered in Management Information Systems, with a major in Information Technology and Management from Naveen Jindal School of Management. Needless to say, I'm a **#faceOfJSOM!** I am originally from South Mumbai, the commercial capital of India, and am currently based out of California, USA. I completed my Bachelors in Information Technology, and a technical Diploma in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai, India. Over this time, I have served many positions of responsibilities like Volunteer at ChangingThePresent.org, Data Science Intern at Predactica, Volunteer at UTD - IT Summer Exploration Camp, Business Associate Intern at Fabstudio, Joint Technical Secretary for RGIT - Students' Council, Editorial Secretary for RGIT - ABIT, and many more. Starting my educational journey in technical fields, I have gradually opened my horizon to Business and Management. I believe in life-long learning and often find myself trying out a hand at different tools and technologies. I love making new connections through verious sources, and believe in meaningful interactions within and outside my work environment. That said, I hope we'll cross paths some day! Looking forward to connecting with you. :)
